# Project Proposal: 
The following is the project propsal for CS375 Softwear Engering with the group of the following: Izayah Carlton, Brain Jeffers, Evan Mai and Maia Mendoza. 
## Pitch 
In order to add to the opitons of music creation we will be creating a digital synthesizer. Currently, many physical sythizers are expensive and are not garunteed to have all the necarry features and are too infelexible to add to. In recent years there has been a need for people to have the tools play with and create music. 

We firmly belive that the ability to make music should be open and accible to all. Through our own personal experince and our education here at Ursinus we have found music and independat music production to be an important part of our histories and our current lives. This project would contribute to the traditon of open and creative music making, allowing for more people to create new and exciting new music. 

## Scope

### Minimal Viable Product
Using the standard english keyboard, a user will be able to at least play the 12 notes of a wester chromatic scale in equal temperment. Additonaly, a user will be able to asign ocillation by inputing numbers. All of this will be configurable, either by coustoms numbers, or using a preset. Our preset will be based on common use cases, like tuing by fifths or fourths to better work with acoustic instruments, or maybe common apregios like pentatonic scales. 
All of this will be able to be both heard through a laptop, and recorded as a file to your computer. 

### Aspire scope: 
A pretty UI, diffrent tamber/instrument

## Techincal Specs
Our current plan is to write the bulk of the code in python, which we are all capable of. Two of our group memebr have a musical background.
