# Project Proposal: 

In order to add to the opitons of music creation we will be creating a digital synthesizer. Currently, many physical sythizers are expensive and are not garunteed to have all the necarry features and are too infelexible to add too. 

Our current plan is to write the bulk of the code in python, which we are all capable of. Two of our group memebr have a musical background. 

We need keys that play notes. User configurabilty using either wave forms or presets. Noise should be both recorded and out put. 

Aspire scope: A pretty UI, diffrent tamber/instrument

The ability to make music should be open and accible to all. This project would contribute to the traditon of open and creative music making.
